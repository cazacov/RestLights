#Installation

Start with the latest version of Raspbian (tested with ver. 2016-11-25)

Check if Node.js is included
```
node --version
```

If Node.js is not there, follow this [guide](http://raspberryalphaomega.org.uk/2014/06/11/installing-and-using-node-js-on-raspberry-pi/ "nstalling and using node.js on Raspberry Pi").
